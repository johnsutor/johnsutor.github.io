title: "Evaluating The Performance of Synthetic Visual Data for Real-Time Object Detection"
conference: IEEE Preprint
abstract: A method to produce synthetic visual data was developed and the resulting synthetic imagery was used to train a YOLOv3 classification model to identify various species of sea turtles. Synthetic images were rendered and augmented via Blender’s bpy library and Python interface, and stored in the team’s SynthBlend repository. YOLOv3 was then trained on multiple ratios of authentic and synthetic visual data to test which ratio of data produced the most confident model. The researchers optimized the classification model and demonstrated significant accuracy improvements, especially with models trained without authentic data. The fully synthetic dataset  performed best in testing, with an average confidence level of 9.68 percent greater than the fully authentic dataset.
