title: "AI and undergraduate research: A dialog in project-based learning"
conference: SITE 2020
abstract: The current research explores the use of artificial intelligence as a teaching tool. The research team determined that an artificial intelligence project-based learning task can effectively be used to introduce undergraduate computer science students to machine learning and its associated work pipeline. This includes collecting data, labeling data, and then training an algorithm on the labeled data. We found that there is a lack of current knowledge discussing the best practices for approaching the machine learning task pipeline, subsequently, the research team discovered that certain aspects of the pipeline, such as data verification, can take up a large portion of the workload.
