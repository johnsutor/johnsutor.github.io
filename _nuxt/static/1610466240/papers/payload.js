The current research examined articles related to research trends in artificial intelligence training intended to improve computer vision and object detection. Search strings were developed and used to retrieve research articles from the ACM and IEEE databases. The resulting articles were examined for trends, general practices, disciplines where the greatest efforts have been made, advances, and relevant production processes. The research reveals that visual synthetic data encompasses filtering, augmentation and object domain randomization techniques.  Further, all of the research that included an evaluation of synthetic visual data suggest  that there are noteworthy performance improvements in accuracy. Additionally, producing realistic synthetic data reduces the current limitations related to labeling, image quality, paucity of relevant data, and privacy issues.",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fieeexplore.ieee.org\u002FXplore\u002Fhome.jsp",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:b,path:"\u002Fpapers\u002F2",extension:c,slug:"2",createdAt:"2021-01-01T15:48:49.711Z",updatedAt:"2021-01-01T15:54:06.608Z"},{title:"AI and undergraduate research: A dialog in project-based learning",conference:"SITE 2020",abstract:"The current research explores the use of artificial intelligence as a teaching tool. The research team determined that an artificial intelligence project-based learning task can effectively be used to introduce undergraduate computer science students to machine learning and its associated work pipeline. This includes collecting data, labeling data, and then training an algorithm on the labeled data. We found that there is a lack of current knowledge discussing the best practices for approaching the machine learning task pipeline, subsequently, the research team discovered that certain aspects of the pipeline, such as data verification, can take up a large portion of the workload.",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.learntechlib.org\u002Fp\u002F215929\u002F",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:b,path:"\u002Fpapers\u002F1",extension:c,slug:"1",createdAt:"2021-01-01T15:39:52.288Z",updatedAt:"2021-01-01T15:48:45.302Z"}]}],mutations:void 0}}("root","\u002Fpapers",".md")));
